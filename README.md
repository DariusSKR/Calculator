# Calculator

This is a simple calculator. It doesn't know a lot of operations, so be kind to it. For simplicity it will show up to 2 digits after the comma.

It was done using Flexbox and also it contains media queries for web responsivness.

Another thing worth mentioning: if you write '100+40' and add another operation, it will solve the current one and go to the next one, without the need to press '=' for every calculation.

Things that could be improved remain:

->Solve the 'Number++' problem, meaning if i want to write '3++' it will show NaN+ as a result.

->Add keypress functionality
